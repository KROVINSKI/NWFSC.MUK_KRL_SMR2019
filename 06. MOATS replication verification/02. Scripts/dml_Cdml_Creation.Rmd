# 3.) Creating the Dataframe "dml"

With the "M01thruM13moatslog.csv" document created, it can be read and result in a dataframe. 

```{r}

#*********************************
## 3.) Creating the Dataframe "dml" 
#*********************************

## 3.1 Reading the CSV |  
## ensuring column names and types
## Data Moats Log = dml
dml <- read.csv(file = "../M01thruM13moatslog.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(dml)
getwd()
```

Results of the dimensions query results with 1,030,456 observations with 7 variables.
Need to subsample

```{r}
# * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
## 3.1a Sub sampling dataframe "dml"  
# * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
## creating a sub sample of the data moats log dml dataframe to allow for quick graphs 
#subsample every 17th row (because prime numbers are indeed cool)
dml <- dml %>% arrange(moats, dateTime) %>% filter(row_number() %% 17 == 0)

```

Observations are now spaced 6.8minutes apart

Arranging variables to the appropriate factors, levels, classes etc. 

```{r}
## 3.2 Checking variables | 

## Looking to ensure the different variables are treated as the correct variable type
## Checking the names in the dataframe
names(dml)
## Checking variable type/class 
class(dml$moats)
factor(moats)

## 3.3 Changing variables | 
## Changing MOATs to Factors for the 13 different MOATs- these will be the discrete units for follow analysis
dml$moats <- factor(dml$moats)
# Checking the names of the different levels
levels(dml$moats)
##checking the dataset, dimensions
dim(dml)
```

# 4.) Creating dateTime objects

dateTime objects are created from the observations's date and time. 

```{r}
# 4.0 establish the date time object of the CSV |
dml$dateTime <- as.POSIXct(dml$dateTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS")
ReferenceTime <- as.POSIXct("2019-09-20 23:59:00")
class(ReferenceTime)

```

# 5.) Creating Treatment Variables 

The database dml exists without the MOATs' treatments identified
Four different types of treatments are defined.
"Ambient" MOATS were included with broken MOATS into one treatment group. 
The script "dml_df_graphing_droppedMoats_andoutliers.R" does include "Ambient 04" and "Ambient 05" as thier own distinct treatments.   


```{r}
## 5.1 Identifying moats per treatment |
## creating a new dataframe
## establishing treatments
dml$treatment <- ""
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M07" | dml$moats== "M10" | dml$moats== "M12"] <- "current"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M01"| dml$moats== "M06"] <- "hightemperature"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M02"| dml$moats== "M08" | dml$moats== "M13"] <- "allchange"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M03"| dml$moats == "M04" | dml$moats == "M05" | dml$moats== "M11"] <- "broken_and_ambientbroken"
#verify that this new column has been created
names(dml)
#results should include:
#[1] "moats"        "dateTime"     "aTemperature" "sTemperature" "pH"          
#[6] "DO"           "salinity"     "treatment"  

```


Notice that there are eight variables, treatment is the new, eight variable. 


# 6.) Creating Night and Day Periods 

Day and night variables are created in the code below. 
The acclimation period will be defined as other and will then be ultimately excluded. 
Criteria for Day and Night
 + Days and Nights periods changed on 05OCT19 from 1200 to 1230
 + Treatment start date considered to begin Monday 23SEP19 at 1200pm
 + Krill Night Starts 1200 (~1230*) and ends 2100
 + Krill Days Starts 2101 and ends 1159 (~1229*) 
 + Interval 1 start 1200 23SEP19, end 1229 05OCT19
 + Interval 2 start 1230 05OCT19, end 2100 30OCT19


```{r}
dml$period <- ""


# Create new split date and time columns
dml$ObservationDate <- as.Date(dml$dateTime)
dml$ObservationTime <- format(as.POSIXct(dml$dateTime) ,format = "%H:%M:%S")


## 6.2 Narrative (Intervals) 
# Interval 1
  ## Interval Date Start  "2019-09-23"
  ## Interval Date End    "2019-10-05"
  ## Day Start Time       "21:01:00"
  ## Day End Time         "12:01:00"
  ## Night Start Time     "12:00:00"
  ## Night End Time       "21:00:00"
  ## Other Time
# Interval 2
  ## Interval Date Start  "2019-10-05"
  ## Interval Date End    "2019-10-30"
  ## Day Start Time       "21:01:00"
  ## Day End Time         "12:29:00"
  ## Night Start Time     "12:30:00"
  ## Night End Time       "21:00:00"
  ## Other Time

##6.3 Applying the tidyverse 
# Using the "case_when" function in the tidyverse in the place of a loop

dml <- dml %>% mutate(period=case_when(
                          (ObservationDate >= "2019-09-23") 
                          & (ObservationDate <="2019-10-05") 
                          & (ObservationTime >= "12:00:00") 
                          & (ObservationTime <="21:00:00") ~"night",
                          
                          (ObservationDate >= "2019-10-05")
                          & (ObservationDate <= "2019-10-30")
                          & (ObservationTime >= "12:30:00") 
                          & (ObservationTime <="21:00:00") ~"night",
                          
                          (ObservationDate >= "2019-09-23") 
                          & (ObservationDate <="2019-10-05")
                          & ((ObservationTime >= "21:01:00") 
                          | (ObservationTime <="11:59:00")) ~"day",
                          
                          (ObservationDate >= "2019-10-05")
                          & (ObservationDate <= "2019-10-30")
                          & ((ObservationTime >= "21:01:00")
                          | (ObservationTime <= "12:29:00")) ~"day",
                          TRUE ~"other"
                        )

                    ) 

```

# 7.) Insitu data

As researchers took DO samples, aquarium temperatures were recorded

```{r}



d.insitu <- read.csv(file = "../KRL19_insitu_sample_Day.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
n.insitu <- read.csv(file = "../KRL19_insitu_sample_Night.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


# 8.) Cleaning up dml 

Changes to be made the dataframe by variable:
1. "moats" "M03", "M04", "M05", "M09", "M11" to be filtered out- all these MOATs were dropped from the study
2. "dateTime" - no changes
3. "aTemperature" - limits set on temperature 
 + NOTE: Researcher assumed that the aquarium never heated above 30C/86F and never cooled to 5C/41F  
4. "sTemperature" - no changes    
5. "pH" - no changes
6. "DO"- no changes
7. "salinity" - no changes 
8. "treatment" - dropping the listed MOATs will eliminate the "broken_and_ambientbroken" treatment
9. "period" - filtering out "other"
10. "ObservationDate" - no changes
11. "ObservationTime" - no changes, note that each observation could be spaced 6.8minutes apart


```{r}
         
Cdml <- dml %>% filter(!moats %in% c("M03", "M04", "M05", "M11")) %>%
  filter(aTemperature>= 5 & aTemperature<=30) %>%
  filter(treatment %in% c("current", "allchange", "hightemperature")) %>%
  filter(period != "other")

# write.csv(dml, file = "2020.05.08_Cdml.csv", row.names = FALSE)

levels(Cdml$moats)

Cdml$moats <- droplevels(Cdml$moats)
```


# 9.) Framing the filters - Cdml

The commands below were inclided in the script in an effort to clean up eventual graphing.

```{r}

filteredFrame = filter(Cdml,
  !moats %in% c('M03', "M04", "M05", "M11") & 
  (aTemperature>= 5 & aTemperature<=30) &
  treatment %in% c("current", "allchange", "hightemperature") &
  period != "other")


filteredFrame$moats <- droplevels(filteredFrame$moats)
filteredFrame$treatment <- factor(filteredFrame$treatment)
```


# 10.) Temperature Jump flag logic

When plotted against simple timeseries there appeared to be "unexplained" temperature jumps up to 15C creating one band and another band around 11C. These points appeared without a gradual rise and fall. These points are/were not true outliers but there was a need to highlight them. 
The section below details the commands used to highlight jumps in temperature:

```{r}


Cdml <- filteredFrame %>% arrange(moats, dateTime)%>% 
  mutate(deltaTempLag1 = c(0,abs(diff(aTemperature))))

#the diff value comparing the last time in M01 to the first time in M02 (etc.) is not valid, 
#so set those to zero

Cdml$deltaTempLag1[lag(Cdml$moats) != cdml$moats] <- 0

#this shows all the rows that jump more that 1 degree from previous row (ingoring rows that are transition from one moats to another)

Cdml %>% filter(deltaTempLag1 >1)

#Creating another column of variables to be able to graph the temperature jumps 

Cdml <- Cdml %>% mutate(tDeltaThreshold = if_else(deltaTempLag1 > 0.3, TRUE, FALSE))
```


# 11.) Calculating averages by treatment & day/night

The follow portion was created to have Y-intercepts to plot along boxplots 

```{r}
# These averages will be the yintercepts in plots
# example of what to put into with ggplot " + geom_hline(yintercept = dtemperatur$`mean(aTemperature)`)   " 


# Night Period
subsetNightaTemp <- subset(filteredFrame, period == "night" & aTemperature >0,
                                  select = c( moats, dateTime, treatment, aTemperature ))

# Day Period

```

Below is a section written to create a table of these averages: 

```{r}
meanCdmldatemp <- filteredFrame %>% group_by(treatment, period) %>% summarise(mean(aTemperature))
# Groups:   treatment [3]

# 6 hightemperature night                  13.8
print(meanCdmldatemp)

```


# 12.) Summary & Group by Cdml

Code for table: 

```{r}
#  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
