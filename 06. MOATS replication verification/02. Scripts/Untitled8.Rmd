### Title: Aquarium Temperature Investigation: Temperature SubSelectScript.R 
### Date: April-May 2020

# Aquarium Temperature Investigation
R script below will subselect and plot temperature data for MOATs
Overall goal is to determine if MOATs (per treatment) are true replicates

## Outline 
(Current as of 2020.06.25)

* 1.) Working Directory
* 2.) Spolling Data into one CSV 
* 3.) Creating the Dataframe "dml"
* 4.) Setting a new working directory
* 4.) Creating dateTime objects 
* 5.) Creating Treatment Variables
* 6.) Creating Night and Day Periods
* 7.) Insitu data



#1.) Working Directory

Inside the working directory (folder) are CSV files generated after using the moats graph app
[Link to moats.Graph.app](http://github.com/pmcelhany/moatsGraphs.git)
Moving average window (nObs) set to 4. This results in the observations being averaged into a 24second timeframe. CSVs were created for each moats: M01, M02, M03, M04, M05, M06, M07, M08, M09, M10, M11, M12, M13. Files are also available on the OA Google drive.

#*********************************
## 1.) Set working directory
#*********************************
setwd("/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_MOATs_SMR2019/LabViewLogs.AllMOATS")

```



# 2.) Spolling Data into one CSV 
Combining multiple CSV files into 1 document. Original input files from individual LVM (logical volumne management) files off each MOATs.

```{r}
## 2.1 Create a list of files 
# All files to be joined have ext. "csv" can use that pattern to join 
files <- list.files(pattern = ".csv")
print(files)
```


```{r}
## 2.2 Create a temporary place for files 
temp <- lapply(files, fread, sep= ",")
print(temp)
```


```{r}
## 2.3 Create a new vector for Moats data logs 
# "M01thruM13Moatslog_data" via rbind
M01thruM13moatslog_data <- rbindlist(temp)
print(M01thruM13moatslog_data)
```


```{r}
## 2.4 Setting new working directory for output file organization
#Effort ISO avoiding duplicates

setwd("/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_KRL_SMR2019/06. MOATS replication verification")
```


```{r}
## 2.5 Write the new csv document | 
# "M01thruM13moatslog" can uncomment this command line as needed
#write.csv(M01thruM13moatslog_data, file = "M01thruM13moatslog.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

```{r}
## 2.6 Duplication Check
## duplicates observed in "dml" on 2020.05.07  
dup2 <- dml[duplicated(dml),]
#if no dups, Cdml2 has same number of rows as Cdml
dml2 <- dml %>% distinct() 
```
