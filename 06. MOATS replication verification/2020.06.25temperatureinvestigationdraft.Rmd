# Aquarium Temperature Investigation
R script below will subselect and plot temperature data for MOATs
Overall goal is to determine if MOATs (per treatment) are true replicates

#1.) Working Directory

Inside the working directory (folder) are CSV files generated after using the moats graph app
[Link to moats.Graph.app](http://github.com/pmcelhany/moatsGraphs.git)
Moving average window (nObs) set to 4. This results in the observations being averaged into a 24second timeframe. CSVs were created for each moats: M01, M02, M03, M04, M05, M06, M07, M08, M09, M10, M11, M12, M13. Files are also available on the OA Google drive.

```{r}
#*********************************
## 1.) Set working directory
#*********************************
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_MOATs_SMR2019/LabViewLogs.AllMOATS")

#setwd("/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_MOATs_SMR2019/LabViewLogs.AllMOATS")

```



# 2.) Spolling Data into one CSV 
Combining multiple CSV files into 1 document. Original input files from individual LVM (logical volumne management) files off each MOATs.
2.1 Create a list of files
```{r}
## 2.1 Create a list of files 
# All files to be joined have ext. "csv" can use that pattern to join 
files <- list.files(pattern = ".csv")
print(files)
```

2.2 Create a temporary place for files
```{r}
## 2.2 Create a temporary place for files 
temp <- lapply(files, fread, sep= ",")
print(temp)
```

2.3 Create a new vector for Moats data logs
```{r}
## 2.3 Create a new vector for Moats data logs 
# "M01thruM13Moatslog_data" via rbind
M01thruM13moatslog_data <- rbindlist(temp)
print(M01thruM13moatslog_data)
```

2.4 Setting new working directory
```{r}
## 2.4 Setting new working directory for output file organization
#Effort ISO avoiding duplicates

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_KRL_SMR2019/06. MOATS replication verification")
```

2.5 Write the new csv document
```{r}
## 2.5 Write the new csv document | 
# "M01thruM13moatslog" can uncomment this command line as needed
#write.csv(M01thruM13moatslog_data, file = "M01thruM13moatslog.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

# 3.) Creating the Dataframe "dml" 

3.1 Reading the CSV
```{r}
## 3.1 Reading the CSV |  
## ensuring column names and types
## Data Moats Log = dml
dml <- read.csv( file = "M01thruM13moatslog.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(dml)
```


3.1a Duplication Check
```{r}
## 3.1a Duplication Check
## duplicates observed in "dml" on 2020.05.07  
dup2 <- dml[duplicated(dml),]
#if no dups, Cdml2 has same number of rows as Cdml
dml2 <- dml %>% distinct() 
```



3.1b Sub sampling dataframe "dml"
```{r}
## 3.1b Sub sampling dataframe "dml"  
## creating a sub sample of the data moats log dml dataframe to allow for quick graphs 


#subsample every 17th row (because prime numbers are indeed cool)
dml <- dml %>% arrange(moats, dateTime) %>% filter(row_number() %% 17 == 0)

write.csv(dml, file = "M01thruM13moatslog_n17.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

3.2 Checking variables
```{r}
## 3.2 Checking variables  
## Looking to ensure the different variables are treated as the correct variable type
## Checking the names in the dataframe
names(dml)
## Checking variable type/class 
class(dml$moats)
dml$moats <- as.factor(dml$moats)
```




3.3 Changing variables
```{r}
## 3.3 Changing variables | 
## Changing MOATs to Factors for the 13 different MOATs- these will be the discrete units for follow analysis
dml$moats <- factor(dml$moats)
# Checking the names of the different levels
levels(dml$moats)
##checking the dataset, dimensions
dim(dml)
```


#4.) Creating dateTime objects

4.0 establish the dateTime objects
```{r}
# 4.0 establish the date time object of the CSV |
dml$dateTime <- as.POSIXct(dml$dateTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS")
ReferenceTime <- as.POSIXct("2019-09-20 23:59:00")
class(ReferenceTime)

# QA check
dim(dml)
```


# 5.) Creating Treatment Variables  

 5.1 Identifying Treatments by MOATS
```{r}
## 5.1 Identifying treatments by moats 
## establishing treatments
dml$treatment <- ""
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M07" | dml$moats== "M10" | dml$moats== "M12"] <- "current"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M01"| dml$moats== "M06"] <- "hightemperature"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M02"| dml$moats== "M08" | dml$moats== "M13"] <- "allchange"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M03"| dml$moats == "M04" | dml$moats == "M05" | dml$moats== "M11"] <- "broken_and_ambientbroken"
#verify that this new column has been created
names(dml)
#results should include:
#[1] "moats"        "dateTime"     "aTemperature" "sTemperature" "pH"          
#[6] "DO"           "salinity"     "treatment"  

# QA check
dim(dml)
```


5.2 Simple ggplot to show the different MOATs without polish
```{r}

plot5.2 <- ggplot(dml, aes(x=dateTime, y=aTemperature)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=moats, point=)) + 
  ggtitle("All MOATs, All Treatment aTemperature Time Series") 

plot5.2

```

# 6.) Creating Night and Day Periods

6.1 Narrative (Overall)
Creating a day and night variables 
Day and night periods exclude the acclimation period by their definition.
Day and night changed at about ~ 1230 on 05OCT19 
Treatment start date considered to begin Monday 23SEP19 at 1200pm

Krill Night Started 1200 (~1230*) and ends 2100
Krill Days Started 2101 and ends 1159 (~1229*) 

#### Interval 1 start 1200 23SEP19, end 1229 05OCT19
#### Interval 2 start 1230 05OCT19, end 2100 30OCT19

6.5 Day / Night Assignments 
```{r}
## 6.5 Day / Night Assignments 
# Using the "case_when" function in the tidyverse in the place of a loop

dml <- dml %>% mutate(period=case_when(
                          (ObservationDate >= "2019-09-23") 
                          & (ObservationDate <="2019-10-05") 
                          & (ObservationTime >= "12:00:00")

                        )

                    ) 
```


# 7.) Insitu data  


7.0 In-situ data files
Two files represent manual checks of aquarium salinity.
Extracted from this are point measurements of aquarim temperature

```{r}
## 7.1 Read in files
# carefule about navigating to the second working directory
read_csv()

d.insitu <- read.csv(file = "KRL19_insitu_sample_Day.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
n.insitu <- read.csv(file = "KRL19_insitu_sample_Night.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```




# 8.) Cleaning up dml  

Creating a new dataframe cleaned with the various filters below
checking on the variables inside dml
Cleaned-Up dml = Cdml


```{r}
## 8.1 Noting names of the different variables in dml
names(dml)
```


# 8.2 Narrative on desired changes to create Cdml

8.2 Narrative on Cdml
Temperatures below 5C and above 30C are thought to be less than probable 
```{r}
# Changes to be made the dataframe by variable
#[1] "moats" "M03", "M04", "M05", "M09", "M11" to be filtered out- all these 
#                                           MOATs were dropped from the study
#[2] "dateTime" - no changes
#[3] "aTemperature" - no changes 
#[4] "sTemperature" - no changes    
#[5] "pH" - no changes
#[6] "DO"- no changes
#[7] "salinity" - no changes 
#[8] "treatment" - dropping the listed MOATs will eliminate the 
#                           "broken_and_ambientbroken" treatment
#[9] "period" - filtering out "other"
#[10] "ObservationDate" - no changes
#[11] "ObservationTime" - no changes, note that each observation could be 
#                                                 spaced 6.8minutes apart
          
Cdml <- dml %>% filter(!moats %in% c("M03", "M04", "M05", "M11")) %>%
  filter(aTemperature>= 5 & aTemperature<=30) %>%
  filter(treatment %in% c("current", "allchange", "hightemperature")) %>%
  filter(period != "other")
