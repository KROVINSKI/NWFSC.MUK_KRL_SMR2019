### Title: Aquarium Temperature Investigation: Temperature SubSelectScript.R 
### Date: April-May 2020

# Aquarium Temperature Investigation
R script below will subselect and plot temperature data for MOATs
Overall goal is to determine if MOATs (per treatment) are true replicates

## Outline 
(Current as of 2020.06.25)

* 1.) Working Directory
* 2.) Spolling Data into one CSV 
* 3.) Creating the Dataframe "dml"
* 4.) Setting a new working directory
* 4.) Creating dateTime objects 
* 5.) Creating Treatment Variables
* 6.) Creating Night and Day Periods
* 7.) Insitu data



#1.) Working Directory

Inside the working directory (folder) are CSV files generated after using the moats graph app
[Link to moats.Graph.app](http://github.com/pmcelhany/moatsGraphs.git)
Moving average window (nObs) set to 4. This results in the observations being averaged into a 24second timeframe. CSVs were created for each moats: M01, M02, M03, M04, M05, M06, M07, M08, M09, M10, M11, M12, M13. Files are also available on the OA Google drive.

```{r}
#*********************************
## 1.) Set working directory
#*********************************
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_MOATs_SMR2019/LabViewLogs.AllMOATS")

#setwd("/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_MOATs_SMR2019/LabViewLogs.AllMOATS")

```



# 2.) Spolling Data into one CSV 
Combining multiple CSV files into 1 document. Original input files from individual LVM (logical volumne management) files off each MOATs.
2.1 Create a list of files
```{r}
## 2.1 Create a list of files 
# All files to be joined have ext. "csv" can use that pattern to join 
files <- list.files(pattern = ".csv")
print(files)
```

2.2 Create a temporary place for files
```{r}
## 2.2 Create a temporary place for files 
temp <- lapply(files, fread, sep= ",")
print(temp)
```

2.3 Create a new vector for Moats data logs
```{r}
## 2.3 Create a new vector for Moats data logs 
# "M01thruM13Moatslog_data" via rbind
M01thruM13moatslog_data <- rbindlist(temp)
print(M01thruM13moatslog_data)
```

2.4 Setting new working directory
```{r}
## 2.4 Setting new working directory for output file organization
#Effort ISO avoiding duplicates

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_KRL_SMR2019/06. MOATS replication verification")
```

2.5 Write the new csv document
```{r}
## 2.5 Write the new csv document | 
# "M01thruM13moatslog" can uncomment this command line as needed
#write.csv(M01thruM13moatslog_data, file = "M01thruM13moatslog.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```


Saved on the OA Google Drive
[M01thruM13moatslog.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15iBXct9b4EjKDq75vKnm5NobowBwK3G-)

2.6 Duplication Check
```{r}
## 2.6 Duplication Check
## duplicates observed in "dml" on 2020.05.07  
dup2 <- dml[duplicated(dml),]
#if no dups, Cdml2 has same number of rows as Cdml
dml2 <- dml %>% distinct() 
```



# 3.) Creating the Dataframe "dml" 

3.1 Reading the CSV
```{r}
## 3.1 Reading the CSV |  
## ensuring column names and types
## Data Moats Log = dml
dml <- read.csv(file = "M01thruM13moatslog.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(dml)
```

3.1a Sub sampling dataframe "dml"
```{r}
## 3.1a Sub sampling dataframe "dml"  
## creating a sub sample of the data moats log dml dataframe to allow for quick graphs 
#subsample every 17th row (because prime numbers are indeed cool)
dml <- dml %>% arrange(moats, dateTime) %>% filter(row_number() %% 17 == 0)

write.csv(dml, file = "M01thruM13moatslog_n17.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

3.2 Checking variables
```{r}
## 3.2 Checking variables  
## Looking to ensure the different variables are treated as the correct variable type
## Checking the names in the dataframe
names(dml)
## Checking variable type/class 
class(dml$moats)
factor(moats)
```


3.3 Changing variables
```{r}
## 3.3 Changing variables | 
## Changing MOATs to Factors for the 13 different MOATs- these will be the discrete units for follow analysis
dml$moats <- factor(dml$moats)
# Checking the names of the different levels
levels(dml$moats)
##checking the dataset, dimensions
dim(dml)
```


#4.) Creating dateTime objects

4.0 establish the dateTime objects
```{r}
# 4.0 establish the date time object of the CSV |
dml$dateTime <- as.POSIXct(dml$dateTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS")
ReferenceTime <- as.POSIXct("2019-09-20 23:59:00")
class(ReferenceTime)

# QA check
dim(dml)
```


# 5.) Creating Treatment Variables  

 5.1 Identifying Treatments by MOATS
```{r}
## 5.1 Identifying treatments by moats 
## establishing treatments
dml$treatment <- ""
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M07" | dml$moats== "M10" | dml$moats== "M12"] <- "current"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M01"| dml$moats== "M06"] <- "hightemperature"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M02"| dml$moats== "M08" | dml$moats== "M13"] <- "allchange"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M03"| dml$moats == "M04" | dml$moats == "M05" | dml$moats== "M11"] <- "broken_and_ambientbroken"
#verify that this new column has been created
names(dml)
#results should include:
#[1] "moats"        "dateTime"     "aTemperature" "sTemperature" "pH"          
#[6] "DO"           "salinity"     "treatment"  

# QA check
dim(dml)
```


5.2 Simple ggplot to show the different MOATs without polish
```{r}
plot5.2 <- ggplot(dml, aes(x=dateTime, y=aTemperature))
            
plot5.2
```
